# Birds-In-The-Sky-Object-Detection
This project explores a simple yet effective object detection method using OpenCV to identify birds flying in the sky. The solution is designed to detect objects where birds are visibly darker than the background, leveraging computer vision techniques like adaptive thresholding and contour detection.
